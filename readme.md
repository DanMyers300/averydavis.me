Changes:

1: Change subheading under name, poor grammar and I want to add more maybe

2: add in free 15 minute zoom/phone consult, and ability to request one w parent email/phone number, perhaps send a different calendly link with 15 min sessions. button on homepage

3: Want academic tutoring vs coaching to be a dropdown, and include a session overview for each (I need to write)

4: Want a dropdown for "How to Schedule session" Thinking instead of linking to google calendar, having payment end up redirecting you to a calendly with options for reoccuring sessions/one time sessions with parents email/phone number/their name/students name. After they schedule, auto email sends with our appointment date/time and my zoom personal room and password.

5: i want to be able to assess a lot more from first look. i.e. how much I charge "from 45 an hour"
 
6: About needs organization and Subheading, maybe some cool animation or image elements when Im talking about executive functions and subjects. Qualifications and stuff should include my AP Scores, SAT, and GPA maybe?
