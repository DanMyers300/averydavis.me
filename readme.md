Introduction

Hello, I'm Avery Davis, an academic tutor and coach based in Dallas, TX, with two years of experience dedicated to helping students boost their confidence and improve their academic abilities. I approach my clients with a positive, kind, and patient attitude, and I prioritize research-based learning with a progress focused approach to tutoring. Additionally, my relative youth and recent involvement in the collegiate and high school educational systems bring an extra advantage to my students!

 My clientele encompasses a diverse range of ages, from 2nd graders to college students. I recognize that learning is a unique journey for each individual, and I tailor each session to meet my students' specific needs, accommodating their personal learning styles. 

I conduct virtual sessions via Zoom, schedule your first session with me today!

If you would  prefer in-person lessons for your learner, reach out to me with a time, day, and location in mind and I am happy to discuss it with you. 


Progress focused Tutoring:

In all of my tutoring services, I follow progress based tutoring. Each session, I’ll review with my students how they feel they are doing in their subject, if their grade is improving, and our strategy for the class going forward. This is important because some students may struggle with timeliness on assignments or focus, while others may struggle with curriculum. Speaking with the student and oftentimes the parents gives me insight on how to best tailor my services to your student.

With my Academic Coaching students, their grades will be more of a focus, with my detailed report of our session including missing work, low test scores/missing work, and what we will do to remedy them.

Thank you so much for the detailed feedback Avery, I read every single one! I’m so happy you’re working with Lola. She had a rough go from being sick but she told me to that she is going to make an “academic comeback”. I told her that I love the positive attitude. 



Why me?
 
I graduated from the Liberal Arts and Science Academy, a prestigious high school ranked 32nd best in the United States. During my time there, I not only tackled rigorous courses but managed to maintain a strong GPA. This achievement earned me a full-ride scholarship along with a semesterly stipend courtesy of the University of Texas at Dallas through their Academic Excellence Scholarship.

My passion for learning, teaching, and mentorship runs deep, and I believe my background in this field truly sets me apart. I graduated with a B.S. in Psychology with honors, and I'm currently continuing my own education, pursuing an M.S. in Applied Cognition and Neuroscience, with goals to continue my passion for helping students as a Professor. My background in psychology equips me with insights into memory, personality, and communication that I can't wait to share with my students.

Academic Coaching versus tutoring:

Academic Tutoring
 Academic Tutoring is for students struggling with just the material in a class. If your student is doing well in most classes, isn’t forgetting to turn in or submit assignments, and is just struggling with the curriculum, Academic Tutoring will focus on honing their understanding of a particular subject. 

Academic Coaching
Academic Coaching is for students who need extra help with organization and building executive functioning skills! Executive functioning consists of: Attention, Planning, Organization, Self-Control, Time-Management, and Working Memory. If your student needs more help in these domains, Academic Coaching may be a better fit. We will focus on how the student keeps track of assignments, upcoming exams, and extracurriculars; Study skills and when to start studying for an upcoming exam; and how the student keeps their various classes organized. 

 For both academic tutoring and coaching, you will receive an email on your child’s progress including grades, areas of concern, and things to celebrate! 


Payment
.

I charge $37/hr for Academic Tutoring, and $45/hr for Academic Coaching. I offer tutoring once or more a week, depending on the student's needs! I accept payment via Venmo or Zelle.
