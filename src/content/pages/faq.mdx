## Frequently Asked Questions:

#### When I schedule what happens?

    - I will receive and email and reach out to schedule a free 15 minute consult.

#### How does payment work?

    - I accept payment via Venmo and Zelle. I charge $50/hr for Academic Tutoring, and $60/hr for Academic Coaching. I offer tutoring once or more a week, depending
on the student's needs! I will request payment every two weeks on Sunday. If you need to cancel our weekly appointment, let me know as soon as you can! If you
cancel within 24 hours of our appointment, or do not show up to the Zoom meeting, I will still bill you for the session.
