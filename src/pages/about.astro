        Hello, I'm Avery Davis, an academic tutor and coach based in Dallas, TX, with two years of experience dedicated to helping students boost their
        confidence and improve their academic abilities.

        <br />
        <br />

        I approach my clients with a positive, kind, and patient attitude, and I prioritize research-based learning. Additionally, my relative youth and recent
        involvement in the collegiate and high school educational systems bring an extra advantage to my students! My clientele encompasses a diverse range of
        ages, from 2nd graders to college students. I recognize that learning is a unique journey for each individual, and I tailor each session to meet my
        students' specific needs, accommodating their personal learning styles.

        <br />
        <br />

        I conduct virtual sessions via Zoom, schedule your first session with me today! Why me? I graduated from the Liberal Arts and Science Academy, a
        prestigious high school ranked 32nd best in the United States. During my time there, I not only tackled rigorous courses but managed to maintain a
        strong GPA. This achievement earned me a full-ride scholarship along with a semesterly stipend courtesy of the University of Texas at Dallas through
        their Academic Excellence Scholarship. I graduated with a B.S. in Psychology with honors, and I'm currently continuing my own education, pursuing an
        M.S. in Applied Cognition and Neuroscience. My passion for psychology runs deep, and I believe my background in this field truly sets me apart. It
        equips me with insights into memory, personality, and communication that I can't wait to share with my students.

        Academic Tutoring vs Academic Coaching: Academic tutoring is for students struggling with just the material in a class. If your student is doing well in
        most classes, isnâ€™t forgetting to turn in or submit assignments, and is just struggling with the curriculum, Academic Tutoring will focus on honing
        their understanding of a particular subject. Academic Coaching is for students who need extra help with organization and building executive functioning
        skills! Executive functioning consists of: Attention, Planning, Organization, Self-Control, Time-Management, and Working Memory. If your student needs
        more help in these domains, Academic Coaching may be a better fit. In both Academic Coaching and Tutoring, I will send an email to the parent/guardian
        discussing the students progress, grades, future assignments, and what we did during our session.
