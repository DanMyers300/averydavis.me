<BaseLayout title="Academic Tutoring">
    Academic tutoring is for students struggling with just the material in a class. If your student is doing well in most classes, isnâ€™t forgetting to turn in
    or submit assignments, and is just struggling with the curriculum, Academic Tutoring will focus on honing their understanding of a particular subject.
