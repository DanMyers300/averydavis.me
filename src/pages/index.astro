                    An academic tutor and coach based in Dallas, TX, with two years of experience dedicated to helping students boost their confidence and
                    improve their academic abilities. I approach my clients with a positive, kind, and patient attitude, and I prioritize research-based
                    learning with a progress focused approach to tutoring. Additionally, my relative youth and recent involvement in the collegiate and high
                    school educational systems bring an extra advantage to my students!
