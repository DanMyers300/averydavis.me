            An academic tutor and coach based in Dallas, TX, with two years of experience dedicated to helping students boost their confidence and improve their academic abilities. I approach my clients with a positive, kind, and patient attitude, and I prioritize research-based learning with a progress focused approach to tutoring. Additionally, my relative youth and recent involvement in the collegiate and high school educational systems bring an extra advantage to my students!

        <h1> Progress focused Tutoring: </h1>
        --------------------------------
        <p>
            In all of my tutoring services, I follow progress based tutoring. Each session, Iâ€™ll review with my students how they feel they are doing in their subject, if their grade is improving, and our strategy for the class going forward. This is important because some students may struggle with timeliness on assignments or focus, while others may struggle with curriculum. Speaking with the student and oftentimes the parents gives me insight on how to best tailor my services to your student.

            With my Academic Coaching students, their grades will be more of a focus, with my detailed report of our session including missing work, low test scores/missing work, and what we will do to remedy them.
